/**
 * Owns the cluster projection lifecycle. An overlay SurfaceView is placed on the
 * cluster display in the app process; its Surface backs a VirtualDisplay created
 * in the shell-uid daemon (Phase 1), onto which Navi's task is pinned.
 *
 * Mirrors OpenBYD ClusterOverlayManager but uses our suspend HelperClient instead
 * of ICarControl shell strings. Single in-memory instance — mode resets to OFF on
 * process death (acceptable for v1; persistence is a later concern).
 *
 * Concurrency: every setMode call runs under [mutex], so two fast polls can't
 * build overlapping overlays or clobber [remoteDisplayId]. The whole transition —
 * including the daemon's VirtualDisplay create + launchAndForce — runs inside the
 * lock, so a poll during an in-flight transition is queued, not dropped.
 *
 * State honesty: [currentMode] advances to the requested mode ONLY when the projection
 * fully succeeds (overlay up + VirtualDisplay created + Navi pinned). On ANY failure it
 * falls back to OFF and Navi is pulled back to the main display, so the in-memory mode
 * always matches what is actually on screen.
 *
 * Threading: WindowManager add/removeView run on Main; daemon calls are suspend
 * (HelperClient switches to IO internally).

     * #134 (Sea Lion 07, DiLink 5.0 eng build): the navigator renders a slice of the map on the
     * cluster and its process dies a few seconds later — long after [HelperClient.launchFreeform]
     * answered OK, so the daemon's own relaunch-once check (2GIS fix, commit 527682c2) has already
     * run and seen a live task. This watch polls the task for a short window afterwards and, when
     * the cluster has lost it, relaunches it ONCE through that same call: with no live task left,
     * the daemon's resolveOrLaunchTask starts the app with `--windowingMode 5 --display N`, so it
     * is BORN on the cluster display and the killing cross-display move never happens.
     *
     * "Lost" means gone OR living on another display: the system restarts a killed foreground app
     * on the main screen, and a task read without its display id would report that restart as a
     * healthy projection while the cluster stays empty (Codex audit). Both cases take the same
     * recovery, with their own journal wording.
     *
     * One relaunch only — a second loss is journaled and the watch ends, no retry loop.
     *
     * The caller holds [mutex]; each check takes it too, so a concurrent setMode is serialized
     * against a relaunch instead of racing it, and the state guard is read under the same lock
     * that writes it. [applyModeLocked] cancels the watch on every mode transition.
     *
     * Healthy fleet (Leopard 3, where the navigator survives the move): three
     * [HelperClient.getTaskState] reads and nothing else — no journal lines, no daemon writes.
