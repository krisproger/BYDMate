/**
 * Opens the cluster's "Map" frame on platformized firmware (BYD OTA V1.6), where the instrument
 * panel ignores whatever we project unless its own CAN registers say a map belongs there.
 *
 * Verified on the car 2026-08-18 (all writes reversible):
 *   - CENTER [FID_CENTER] = [CENTER_MAP] makes the cluster draw the Map frame, i.e. our projected
 *     content becomes visible instead of the native center widget;
 *   - LEFT [FID_LEFT] = [LEFT_CARD] removes the native tire-pressure car widget from the left zone,
 *     so the map shows through there too;
 *   - (verified 2026-08-19) MENU [FID_MENU_SET] = [MENU_HIDDEN] hides both native side cards (left
 *     tire/car card, right compass/clock/music card) for the projection; the status register
 *     [FID_MENU_STATUS] is what we read and put back. The firmware still shows the cards for ~15 s
 *     on a wheel-button press, by design.
 * The stock values on that car were CENTER=7 / LEFT=0, but other cars and cluster modes answer 1 or
 * 0, so the pair is READ at runtime and written back verbatim on [restore] — never assumed.
 *
 * LEFT is the fallback path only ([ownsLeft]): where MENU answers, it takes the left card off screen
 * by itself and hands it back for the wheel-button window, while a LEFT=1 of ours would hold that
 * card off through it (verified on the car 2026-08-19: the right card came back, the left one never
 * did). So LEFT is written, re-asserted and restored only on cars whose menu status will not read.
 *
 * The firmware rewrites CENTER whenever the driver cycles the cluster mode with the wheel knob,
 * which is why [apply] leaves a re-assert job behind.
 *
 * Pre-OTA firmware is untouched: every entry point returns before the first read, write or journal
 * line when [Split37Engine.isPlatformizedFirmware] is false.
 *
 * Concurrency: own [mutex], deliberately NOT [ClusterProjectionManager]'s — the re-assert job runs
 * on the manager's scope and would deadlock against a transition holding that lock.
 *
 * Two features want the same frame ([Owner]): the navigation projection and the blind-spot camera.
 * The first one opens it, a later one joins it, and it goes back to the car only when the last one
 * lets go: neither may hand the cluster back while the other is still drawing on it.
 *
 * Fail-soft: nothing here throws but a cancellation, so a projection is never failed by the frame.
