/**
 * Routes the percent window actions to the CTRL channel on head units whose firmware
 * has no percent window family at all (DiLink 3.0, ~6400 constants — issue #79).
 *
 * Generation is probed lazily on the first window write, from READ fids only. A CTRL
 * candidate needs the full signature: ALL FOUR percent window fids answer
 * DEVICE_THE_FEATURE_LINK_ERROR (65535) AND the alternative-generation fid answers a
 * valid percent. The fids are read one at a time and the probe stops at the first
 * conclusive answer, so a healthy unit costs one read. Every outcome other than a valid
 * percent or the full signature (daemon down, car asleep, any other sentinel, a failed
 * read) leaves the channel UNKNOWN and the write goes out on the existing percent path.
 *
 * Two rails keep transient link errors on a percent-capable unit from cementing CTRL: the
 * full four-fid signature, and a persisted candidate timestamp — CTRL is only written to
 * the store by a second candidate probe at least [CTRL_CONFIRM_MIN_GAP_MS] after the
 * first, which no single cold start can span. Until then the percent path stays in place,
 * and any healthy probe clears the pending candidate.
 *
 * The probe is single-flight (a [Mutex] guards re-check → probe → persist) and its
 * verdict, UNKNOWN included, is memoized in memory for [MEMO_TTL_MS] — except while a
 * candidate is pending, where re-probing is what lets a healthy read clear it. A composite
 * command that fans out to four doors therefore probes once and routes all four the
 * same way.
