/**
 * Single owner of the helper daemon's lifecycle. Idempotent — ensureRunning()
 * converges to "one alive helper of THIS app version".
 *
 * Version awareness (the stale-daemon fix): the daemon is a detached app_process
 * under shell uid that survives app reinstalls and reboots-less updates. A daemon
 * spawned by a previous app version still answers the binder ping but lacks any
 * handler added in the update — so newer ops (sentry mode, assistant disable)
 * silently failed until a head-unit reboot. The authoritative staleness signal is
 * a live query to the daemon itself (TX_GET_VERSION): the daemon's CLASSPATH is
 * frozen at spawn time, so BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE in the running JVM reflects
 * exactly which APK spawned it. A pref-based bookkeeping value can drift (e.g.
 * daemon re-spawned by a boot path after the pref was already updated); the live
 * query cannot.

     *      simultaneously confirms liveness AND that the fresh daemon carries the right version.
