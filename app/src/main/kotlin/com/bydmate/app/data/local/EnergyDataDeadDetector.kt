/**
 * Detects a dead leftover energydata DB (issue #63): the car keeps driving (mileage grows
 * across ignition sessions) while the DB file never changes.
 *
 * A live energydata (Leopard 3 / DiLink 4/5) gains a record around every drive cycle, so
 * its fingerprint changes between sessions and the streak below keeps resetting — by
 * construction the detector can never fire there. On a dead leftover the fingerprint is
 * frozen forever, the streak reaches [DEAD_STREAK_THRESHOLD] and the device is switched
 * to native trip recording until reset (Settings button) or auto-heal (file changes).
 *
 * A file frozen for months (#148: energydata stuck since Nov 2025 on a driving car) does not need
 * the full [DEAD_STREAK_THRESHOLD] to be judged: a driving session over a DB older than
 * [STALE_FILE_AGE_MS] shortens the verdict to two sessions instead of days of an empty trip list.
 * It shortens it, never skips it — the age branch also requires an already-standing streak, so the
 * verdict still rests on two independent anomalies. The head unit's RTC is not trustworthy on its
 * own: it can boot with a forward-jumped clock and evaluate() runs at ignition-on, before time
 * sync, so a single age reading on a live car whose latest record had not landed yet could mark it
 * dead. That verdict is effectively irreversible in its consequences — auto-heal flips the mode
 * back, but HistoryImporter's dedup cleanup is one-shot, so the trips recorded natively in the
 * meantime stay duplicated.
 *
 * The age is checked ONLY in the pendingDriving branch: a car parked for a month has an equally
 * old file and would false-positive on the first-fingerprint branch, while on a live car the
 * fingerprint-change branch is evaluated earlier and heals/resets anyway.
 *
 * All calls come from TripRecorder on the polling collector — no internal locking needed.
 * The "drove this session" marker is persisted mid-session, the moment the distance
 * threshold is crossed, rather than on the ignition-off edge: in the field the head unit
 * powers down with the car, killing the process before an off tick is ever delivered.
