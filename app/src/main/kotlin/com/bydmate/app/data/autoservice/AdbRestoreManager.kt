/**
 * Brings the classic ADB port back after a reboot on firmwares (DiLink builds from mid-2026,
 * «2606») where BYD dropped the init hook that used to keep port 5555 open. Without it the
 * helper daemon never starts and every write feature of the app is dead until the user
 * re-enables ADB by hand.
 *
 * The path is Android's own wireless debugging: switch `adb_wifi_enabled` on (needs
 * WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS, self-granted earlier over the still-alive classic channel), find the
 * `_adb-tls-connect._tcp` port over mDNS, connect to it with the same RSA key the daemon
 * already trusts (it is in `/data/misc/adb/adb_keys`, so no pairing code), and ask the daemon
 * for `tcpip:5555`.
 *
 * Two facts the user cannot be spared: Android refuses to enable wireless debugging without a
 * Wi-Fi connection, and the first enable on each network raises a system dialog that only the
 * user can confirm. Both are surfaced as states, never worked around.
