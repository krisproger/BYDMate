/**
 * Plausibility bound for BYD's own `electricity` column in energydata.
 *
 * The head unit occasionally writes a value that cannot come from this battery (VadimV,
 * 2026-09-12: 54681,2 kWh on a 38,2 km trip whose SOC only moved 92 → 84), and that single
 * record then poisons every week/month/year statistic built on top of it. Such a value is
 * replaced with the SOC-delta estimate, or dropped when there is no usable SOC pair.
 *
 * The pack capacity is deliberately NOT a bound: on a DM-i hybrid the engine recharges the
 * battery mid-trip, so 30 kWh over 200 km out of a 20 kWh pack is an ordinary 15 per 100. Only
 * an absolute ceiling no drive can reach ([MAX_KWH_PER_TRIP]) and the per-100 figure are used.
 *
 * The per-100 ceiling only applies from [MIN_KM_FOR_PER100_RULE] up: a few hundred metres with
 * the heater on is honestly worth hundreds of kWh per 100 km and must be left alone.
 *
 * Plausible values are returned untouched — the healthy fleet sees no change.
