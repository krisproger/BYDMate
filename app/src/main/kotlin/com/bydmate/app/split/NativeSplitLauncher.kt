/**
 * Launches the HEAD UNIT's own split-screen for a [SplitPair], as an alternative to our freeform
 * layout (#139).
 *
 * On firmwares where `enable_freeform_support` is gated (DiLink 5.1 / Android 13) our split cannot
 * run at all, while the firmware's own one still works — so the pair is handed to the firmware and
 * nothing of ours (backdrop, watchdog, pill, session state) is involved. Plain app uid: only
 * startActivity and sendBroadcast, no helper daemon.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, chosen at runtime by [detectThirds]:
 *
 *  - **THIRDS** (DiLink 5.1 / DiLink 6): the proprietary `byd.intent.category.START_IVI_*`
 *    categories. `START_IVI_SECOND` puts the app in the 2/3 pane, `START_IVI_PRIMARY` in the 1/3
 *    pane; the wide app goes first, the narrow one after [THIRDS_GAP_MS] (the sequence BYD Picker
 *    Manager uses on Han L).
 *  - **TOGGLE_50_50** (DiLink 5.0, validated on the car 2026-07-27): launch the wide app, then
 *    broadcast `byd.intent.action.toggleSplitScreen`. The firmware halves the screen, the launched
 *    app takes the primary pane and the system's own app picker appears in the other one — so
 *    [SplitPair.narrowPkg] is deliberately NOT launched here, the user picks it in that picker.
 *
 * [SplitPair.narrowSide] is ignored in both paths: the firmware owns the layout and pane positions
 * are fixed. Ending the split is the user's job through the firmware's own divider buttons.
 *
 * Every failure is swallowed and reported as `false` plus a journal line — a field dump of the
 * split journal is the only diagnostic channel we have on someone else's car.

     *  1. The firmware's own gate: `OneThirdSplitApiImpl` (三七分屏) enables the thirds API when
     *     [THIRDS_PROPS] read "1". Leopard 3 / DiLink 5.0 reads 0 with the second property absent
     *     (live probe 2026-07-27), so the 5.0 fleet lands on TOGGLE_50_50, which is what works there.
     *  2. Any activity on the device declaring the BYD split category in its manifest — an IMPLICIT
     *     query, because an intent with an explicit component (which is what
     *     `getLaunchIntentForPackage` returns) is resolved by PackageManager without matching
     *     categories at all and would answer "supported" on every firmware.
     *
     * Both signals are journalled on every launch, each with its RAW value — a property that reads
     * 0, one that does not exist, and a reflection call that did not go through are three different
     * firmware facts that all end in "not supported", and a dump from a car whose split came up in
     * the wrong mode has to tell them apart. Same for the query: no match and a PackageManager that
     * threw are not the same thing.
