/**
 * Decides how split PANES are typed on this firmware (#130).
 *
 * v3.9.1 retyped the panes from RECENTS to STANDARD so each pane gets its own root task and its
 * own input shield — accepted on-car on Leopard 3 (eng.build.20260106). On the newer
 * eng.build.20260320 firmware (Song L, Sea Lion 07) a STANDARD pane dies on the first tap: the
 * task finishes, the watchdog reports PaneClosed and opens the picker, and the split is unusable.
 * The same cars ran v3.9 fine with RECENTS panes (touch only on the top pane, caption suppressed
 * — a degradation, not a breakage).
 *
 * So STANDARD is opt-in per firmware and everything else falls back to RECENTS: an unknown
 * firmware degrades to the mode that has never been seen to kill a pane.
 *
 * Cluster projection is NOT covered here — it asks for RECENTS unconditionally
 * (ClusterProjectionManager).
 *
 * [fingerprint] is injectable so both branches can be pinned in tests; production reads
 * [Build.FINGERPRINT], which is a non-null platform field on a device but resolves to null under a
 * plain JVM unit test (same idiom as BatchReadGate).
