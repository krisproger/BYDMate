 * sole suspension before the transact is HelperClient.mutex.lock(). Once the transact is in
 * flight it runs to completion regardless of the coroutine timeout, so the client observes the
 * terminal outcome (return value or exception) only AFTER the daemon returns. A "late task move
 * after grace expires" is therefore unreachable: launchAndForce and the watchdog's getTaskState
 * are serialized by HelperClient.mutex (HelperClient:593), so the watchdog cannot observe
 * fullscreen@display0 while launchAndForce is in flight; once launchAndForce returns, the
 * watchdog's departed-branch fires first (SSM:1148) and resolves grace normally — or if the
 * daemon did not move the task, the failure return triggers endClusterSend, clearing grace early.
 *
 * DERIVATION: this deadline is the backstop for a hypothetically missed terminal, not a hard
 * wall-clock ceiling. Its value is derived from the dominant worst-case step (launchAndForce =
 * FORCE_TIMEOUT_MS = 15 000 ms in HelperClient) plus a watchdog-tick buffer (1 000 ms) and a
 * safety margin (2 000 ms). If FORCE_TIMEOUT_MS or any other per-step client timeout grows past
 * DEPARTURE_GRACE_MS, this constant must grow with it.
 *
 * Lengthening the deadline only extends the suppression window under the hypothetical missed-
 * terminal scenario; it has no effect on normal behaviour where grace is cleared deterministically
 * by the terminal-outcome callers of endClusterSend (see CPM for all five call sites).

     *
     * Two-step strategy (preserves the app process when possible so media playback survives):
     * 1. Gentle flip: call setTaskWindowingMode(taskId, 5). On DiLink 5 this resolves to the
     *    shell path `am start --windowingMode 5 --display 0 -n <cmp>` — low-cost, process-safe.
     *    Re-query getTaskState: if mode is now 5, the flip landed → proceed, no force-stop.
     * 2. Fallback: if the flip did not land (mode still != 5 or re-query failed) → forceStop(pkg)
     *    so launchFreeform gets a fresh task that accepts freeform windowing. Skipped while the
     *    [SplitFreeformVerdict] is latched — see the guard below.
     *
     * Fast-path (no flip, no force-stop): task does not exist (taskId == -1) OR is already
     * freeform (windowingMode == 5) OR the task does not live on the split display. Fail-soft:
     * all errors swallowed so launch still proceeds.
     *
     * [splitDisplayOnly] is set by the [startLocked] call sites only, where [placePaneLocked] runs
     * right after and owns the non-split-display cases. [changeApp] keeps the historic behaviour
     * (no gate): there the user explicitly picked the app for the pane and there is no placePane
     * classification behind it to fall back on.
     *
     * The display gate is load-bearing (FIX round 4). The gentle flip resolves to
     * `am start --windowingMode 5 --display 0` in the daemon's setWindowingModeCompat, which drags
     * a task home from wherever it was. Running that before [placePaneLocked] destroyed the two

     * the daemon's moveRootTaskToDisplay + setFocusedRootTask reflection. Up to 391 pane tasks were
     * recents-typed leaves under a shared freeform root (Task L/N), so ATMS rejected the move
     * ("moveRootTaskToTaskDisplayArea: Unknown rootTaskId", on-car 389) and setFocusedRootTask on
     * a leaf id was a silent no-op — yet the final state still read freeform@display0, so the
     * daemon reported OK. Result: backdrop up, panes left behind it (black backdrop + pill).
     * From 392 on panes are STANDARD with their own root tasks, yet a live task is still never
     * handed to the plain launch path: the raise below stays the restart mechanism.
     *
     * Branches, by the live state of [pkg]'s task:
     *
     * 1. **No task** (state null or taskId -1) — clean start. Untouched [HelperClient.launchFreeform]
     *    path: the daemon cold-launches the app in freeform, STANDARD-typed since 392.
     *
     * 2. **Task on the split display** — restart path, [raisePaneLocked]: the Task N mechanism
     *    (`am start --windowingMode 5 --display 0 -n <component>` — STANDARD needs no
     *    `--activityType`, it is what am assigns by default), which Android treats as "bring this
     *    task to front" regardless of task nesting. Anything other than a
     *    confirmed raise ends in force-stop + fresh launch — see [raisePaneLocked].
     *
     * 3. **Task on another display** (displayId > 0, i.e. on the cluster) — first ask
     *    [endClusterProjection] to end our own projection of this package; on success the task
     *    state is re-read and, when the app is back on the split display, the normal raise path
     *    runs. Otherwise force-stop + fresh launch. raiseFreeformTask is never used on a task that
     *    is still on the cluster: `am start --display 0` would yank it off. Plain launchFreeform is
     *    not safe either — its phase 2 moves the task by leaf id, the move throws, and the daemon's
     *    failure path resolves to `am stack remove` + relaunch, so the task leaves the cluster
     *    anyway, just non-deterministically. Force-stop makes that deterministic. Aborting the start
     *    instead would leave the widget tap dead even though the user explicitly asked for a split
     *    with this app; navigators restore their own guidance session after a relaunch (see
     *    setWindowingModeCompat KDoc in HelperDaemon).
     *
     * 4. **Display.INVALID_DISPLAY (-1)** — mid-reparent transient (FIX-C). Re-read the task state
     *    up to [PANE_DISPLAY_REREADS] times, [PANE_DISPLAY_REREAD_DELAY_MS] apart. If it resolves,
     *    the matching branch above runs. If it is still unresolved (or became unreadable) the pane
     *    is force-stopped and relaunched — never handed to launchFreeform as a live task.
     *
     * **Accepted bounded risk (single snapshot, E-2 pattern):** the branch is chosen from a state
     * snapshot, so a task created by an external actor between the snapshot and the launch takes
     * the clean-start path and can still hit the false-OK described above. Closing it would require
     * serialising task creation with the daemon, which this codebase does not do anywhere. It needs
     * a third-party launch inside a ~ms window and self-heals on the next widget tap — by then the
     * task exists and the snapshot puts it on the raise path.
     *
     * **Accepted bounded risk (cluster hook not linearised with CPM):** the interval
     * endClusterProjection → task re-read → raise → Active is NOT serialised against
     * ClusterProjectionManager.setMode. A projection command issued concurrently with the split
     * start can win or lose non-deterministically. This is a race between two contradicting user
     * commands (start the split vs. project this app), the semantics are last-command-wins, and the
     * outcome is bounded and recoverable: CPM's recoverStaleCompositor/recoverStaleDirectTask paths
     * heal the leftover state. A lease/gate over the whole interval was considered and rejected —
     * before this fix there was no coordination here at all (so no regression), and a cross-manager
     * lease would add a new deadlock surface to a point fix.

    /**
     * Poll loop that detects when the BYD stock mediacenter surfaces fullscreen over an active
     * split (triggered by the rotary play/pause knob via BYD's MediaKeyHandler in system_server,
     * which bypasses the standard media-button-session stack and routes directly to
     * com.byd.mediacenter). Runs ONLY while the session is Active; launched by
     * [startMediaPollLocked] and cancelled by [tearDownLocked] / the MAXIMIZED watchdog path.
     *
     * Concurrency: the foreground-package pre-check ([helper.getTopTaskPackageOrSkip]) runs WITHOUT
     * holding [mutex] — it returns null immediately if HelperClient's own mutex is busy, so the
     * 10 Hz poll never queues behind [helper.setFocusedTask]'s 2 s Binder timeout. The expensive
     * [activeSessionPackages] call and all state mutation happen INSIDE [mutex] only on candidate
     * ticks. A second [helper.getTopTaskPackage] call is made inside the lock to guard against
     * stale candidates (see KDoc of [reactToMediaCenterLocked]).
     *
     * Worst-case latency breakdown (per term, so this does not regress):
     *   - [MEDIA_POLL_MS] (100 ms): fixed poll cadence.
     *   - [mutex] wait (0 – ~10.3 s): the [mutex].isLocked gate is a RACY pre-filter, not a
     *     guarantee — the poll can pass the check and then block in `mutex.withLock` for the full
     *     duration of a concurrent changeApp (~10.3 s). This term exists because the Kotlin Mutex
     *     is fair-FIFO and the poll enqueues behind any op already in the queue.
     *   - [helper.getTopTaskPackage] inside the lock (0 – 2 s): the in-lock re-read waits for
     *     HelperClient's own mutex. 19 injection sites (TrackingService sensor readBatch, 5 s budget;
     *     etc.) share that mutex. In the typical case this is near-instant; 2 s is the binder timeout.
     *   - Reaction cost under the lock (~4 s worst): backdrop.show() 2 s + raiseFreeformTask×2 1 s
     *     each (am start RTT, component lookup). setFocusedTask fallback adds 2 s per pane when raise
     *     fails (old daemon); both-fail case adds a hide() but no extra wait.
     *   Total worst case: 100 ms + 10.3 s (mutex wait) + 2 s (in-lock helper) + 4 s (reaction)
     *   ≈ 16.4 s. Typical fast path: ~200 ms (one poll + raise RTT).
     *
     * [helper.getTopTaskPackageOrSkip] pre-check guarantees the HelperClient TX does not queue
     * behind a concurrent setFocusedTask BEFORE we acquire the session mutex, eliminating one
     * contention source. The in-lock re-read still uses the queuing [helper.getTopTaskPackage]
     * because a spurious skip there (missed reroute) is worse than a slow one.
