/**
 * Verifies that VehicleApiImpl wraps composite and seat write sequences in
 * withContext(NonCancellable) so a hard stop that cancels the calling job after the
 * first write of a multi-write command has started cannot leave the car half-commanded.
 *
 * Test strategy: a CompletableDeferred is used to block the first write's mock so the
 * test can cancel the calling job while the sequence is mid-flight. The NonCancellable
 * context prevents the deferred.await() from being interrupted by the cancellation; all
 * writes in the sequence run to completion before the job is actually torn down.
